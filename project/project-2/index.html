          <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>&ldquo;The Indiana Bond Bankâ€™s Flipping Finance Challenge is a public-finance focused innovation summit. The 2020 Flipping Finance Challenge convened Hoosiers with diverse skills and subject matter expertise in one collaborative environment to create solutions to complex local challenges. The Indiana Bond Bank lives to foster an Indiana where the limit of Hoosier possibility is unbound from geography.  Where a statewide fabric of thriving local communities lay the foundation for all Hoosiers to achieve lives of personal fulfillment.&rdquo; - Indiana Bond Bank</p>
<p>The IBB does this by gathering units of government, leading brainstorming sessions, so that ultimately there are challenge tracks formed for participants to collaborate and develop solutions. The 2020 Flipping Finance Challenge gathered the City of Bloomington, Jay County, and Starke County. Each of these counties develops tracks where each challenge is specific to their city/county. Participants then form teams and undergo an 18 hour design sprint to develop solutions. At the end of 18 hours participants turn in their solution to the Indiana Bond Bank. Next, the IBB and the judges gather to review the solutions of the various challenges and select finalists to go through a second round. During the second round the qualifying participants present to the judges of their corresponding track. These judges then select the winners of each track. In the final round all of the winners of the various tracks present their solution to the judges, participants, and guests.</p>
<h2 id="challenge">Challenge</h2>
<p>The track that I participated in was Opportunity Zones, presented by the Fifth Third Foundation. &ldquo;Innovators should build off of the work done by the consortium in order to increase marketing efforts, improve efficiency, or identify gaps that exist between opportunity zones and investors.&rdquo; Together with my partner, Roger Lee, we chose the challenge called &ldquo;Business is Booming? OZ&rsquo;s in Bloomington&rdquo; More information can be <a href="https://inbondbank.com/ffc2020/">found here</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;Monroe County has four areas designated as Opportunity Zones, of which three fall within city limits and represent the most likely investment opportunities in the city. A cottage industry of opportunity zone investments has sprung up nationally, seeking investment opportunities in zones and Bloomington has had some success attracting investments. The challenge is that Opportunity Zones were designed to drive job-creation, but are currently being leveraged simply to improve the returns on developments with limited community and/or job benefit (e.g., student housing developments). The City seeks an improved approach to attract investments with greater community benefit.  So far, City/Bloomington Economic Development Corporation/County have collaborated to highlight Opportunity Zones to local investors via presentations and other marketing efforts; other cities have developed more formal investment prospectus, models that could be employed by Monroe County/City of Bloomington.  Barriers: Municipalities have limited visibility into Opportunity Zone funds/investments; there is no central depository for investment opportunities in the zones.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="solution">Solution</h2>
<p>Together with my partner, Roger Lee, we decided to focus on how technology can be used to leverage the Opportunity Zones present in Bloomington and make that information easily accessible to investors interested in Bloomington. One of the challenges that the city of Bloomington mentioned is that there wasn&rsquo;t a central depository available with the opportunities. The various opportunity zones existed in pdfs throughout different city websites. Navigating the government website to find all the necessary information is a barrier to an investor.</p>
<p>We focused on placing these different pdfs, the opportunity zones, on a map. We wanted one cohesive map that would allow each zone to be a separate layer, allowing for investors to have the information available in one place. We also wanted to create a data storytelling element. Each of these opportunity zones has a story behind its location, and the local citizens of Bloomington could tell their own story. For example, the Certified Technology Parks encourage STEM partnerships between communities, businesses, and universities. This location houses community projects and has important context that could encourage investors interested in technology to look more closely at this area of the city. Our solution is a scrollytelling map that provides this context and allows investors to scroll through these various zones along with their stories.</p>
<p>This was created with Mapbox Studio, which allowed us to create custom geolocations. This tool also allows for users to import existing geocoding data, such as shapefiles and JSON. Once the various opportunity zone layers were created, they were brought together in one single map of Bloomington, IN.</p>
<p>Next, we utilized an open source project called scrollytelling which was created to increase the use of dynamic storytelling with maps and data. This solution uses Vanilla JS, CSS, and HTML to create the scrollytelling map of OZs in Bloomington.</p>
<p>The solution is scalable and can be adopted by other Hoosier cities to attract investors to build and increase business around the state. The final solution is hosted on GitHub Pages and <a href="https://inarreol.github.io/Flipping-Finance-2020/">can be found here</a></p>
<h2 id="lessons-learned">Lessons Learned</h2>
<h3 id="storytelling-is-crucial">Storytelling is Crucial</h3>
<p>The solution that we presented provided the data (opportunity zones) to be housed in one single location, easily accessible to investors and the general public. However, the data storytelling was the compelling component of the solution. The ability for the city of Bloomington to form their own narrative of their city and the opportunities available for investors. The storytelling allows for this project to be more accessible to its citizens to create their own narrative and highlight important community work being done, and persuading investors to enter into the city.</p>
<h3 id="develop-scalable-solutions">Develop Scalable Solutions</h3>
<p>The Flipping Finance Challenge is all about innovation for local challenges. We wanted this solution to provide practical and scalable solutions. Opportunity Zones are available in several cities and counties throughout the state of Indiana. While we chose to focus on Bloomington, we simply wanted to provide an example of the solution. This method could be mimicked throughout other cities and counties.</p>
<p>Mapbox is a great tool because it is the technology that BI tools such as Tableau and Power BI utilize to create the maps inside those programs. Mapbox also allows for developers to use the maps in web development or in app creation. Next, we utilized an open source project which has plenty of documentation for others to follow. Finally we hosted this solution on GitHub Pages, again a free and open source platform which allows anyone to create a website. Additionally, hosting this on GitHub allows for open collaboration across one city or even multiple cities throughout the state.</p>
